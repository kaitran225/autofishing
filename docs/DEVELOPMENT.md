# AutoFishing Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
AutoFishing is a cross-platform automation tool for fishing in games, using pixel detection to identify and respond to fishing events. The application supports both Windows and macOS operating systems with a unified UI experience.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- [x] Platform detection mechanism
- [x] Basic Windows pixel detection implementation
- [x] Basic macOS pixel detection implementation
- [ ] Core fishing detection algorithm
- [ ] Input simulation for fishing actions
- [ ] Configuration system for different games

### Phase 2: User Interface
- [ ] Cross-platform UI framework implementation
- [ ] Settings panel for configuration
- [ ] Visual feedback of detection areas
- [ ] Statistics tracking (fish caught, success rate)
- [ ] Tooltips and help documentation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Game profile system for multiple games
- [ ] Machine learning based detection for improved accuracy
- [ ] Anti-pattern randomization to avoid detection
- [ ] Audio alerts and notifications
- [ ] Remote monitoring via mobile app

### Phase 4: Refinement & Distribution
- [ ] Comprehensive testing across platforms
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Packaging and installers
- [ ] Auto-update system
- [ ] User documentation and tutorials

## Current Focus
- Implementing core pixel detection algorithms
- Building the unified UI framework
- Improving cross-platform compatibility

## Implementation Notes
- Windows version uses `pixel_change_trigger` module for detection
- macOS version uses `mac_pixel_detector` module for detection
- Both implementations will be unified under `AutoFisherApp` UI

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for detection algorithms
- Integration tests for UI and detection
- Cross-platform compatibility tests
- Performance benchmarks
