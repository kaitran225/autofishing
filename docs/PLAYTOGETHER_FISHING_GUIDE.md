## Fish Shadows & Rarity

The size of the shadow you see in the water is a key indicator of what type of fish you might catch. Fish shadows in PlayTogether come in different sizes, which generally correlate with the physical size of the fish:

### Shadow Sizes
- **Small**: Smallest visible shadows in the water
- **Medium**: Moderate-sized shadows, slightly larger than small
- **Large**: Noticeably bigger than medium shadows
- **Extra Large**: Very big shadows
- **Extra Extra Large**: Exceptionally large shadows
- **Gigantic**: The largest possible shadows, typically for special fish

### Important Shadow Size Notes

1. **Shadow Size vs. Rarity**: Shadow size does not always indicate rarity. Some of the rarest fish in the game (like Mini versions of larger fish) have small shadows.

2. **Shadow Size vs. Fish Type**: The shadow size primarily indicates the physical size of the fish, not its category (Basic, Trendy, Luxury, VIP, or VVIP).

3. **Finned Fish**: Some valuable fish like sharks have fins that may be visible above water. However, **the fins can be difficult to see if the fish is facing upwards or during nighttime**, so it's recommended to attempt catching any appropriately sized shadow.

4. **Special Cases**: 
   - Sharks typically have Extra Large shadows, though they're generally not as large as you might expect for such valuable fish
   - Mini variants of VIP fish (like Mini Blue Whale) have Small shadows despite being rare
   - VVIP fish generally have very large shadows (Extra Extra Large or Gigantic) with some exceptions

5. **Shadow Size Distribution by Category**:
   - Basic Fish: Mostly Small to Large shadows
   - Trendy Fish: Mostly Small to Large shadows, with some Extra Large
   - Luxury Fish: Small to Extra Extra Large shadows
   - VIP Fish: Ranges from Small (mini variants) to Gigantic (whales)
   - VVIP Fish: Typically Extra Large to Gigantic, with some exceptions

Understanding shadow sizes helps you target specific fish types more efficiently, especially when combined with knowledge of location and time of day requirements.

## Fishing Tips & Strategies

1. **Best Time to Fish**: Some fish only appear at specific times (All Day, Noon, or Night).
2. **Watch for Ripples**: Look for small rippling circles in the water, which indicate fish presence.
3. **Patience is Key**: Timing your reel-in is crucial for a successful catch.
4. **Focus on Location**: Different fish are found in different bodies of water.
5. **Seasonal Fish**: Some fish are only available during specific seasons or events.
6. **Crowned Variants**: Crowned variants of fish are double the value of regular fish but are more difficult to catch.
7. **Upgrade Your Rod**: Better fishing rods increase your success rate.
8. **Target Valuable Fish**: Focus on catching high-value fish for maximizing profit.

## Collections

Completing specific groups of fish collections rewards players with Gems. The fish journal tracks your progress with each species caught.

Fish are organized in your collection journal by:
- Stillwater fish (freshwater)
- Saltwater fish
- Miscellaneous/junk items

## Aquariums and Display

In your House, you can place an Aquarium where you can display your caught fish without the need for tanks. This allows you to showcase your rarest catches and create an impressive underwater display.

Different aquarium sizes are available from the furniture shop, allowing you to display multiple fish simultaneously.
