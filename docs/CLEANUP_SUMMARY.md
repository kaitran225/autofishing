# Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup changes made to organize the repository according to the structure defined in the autofisher folder.

## Directory Structure

The repository now follows this structure:

```
autofisher/
├── core/             # Core fishing logic and detection algorithms
├── os_adapters/      # OS-specific adapters for different platforms
│   ├── windows/      # Windows-specific implementations
│   ├── macos/        # macOS-specific implementations
│   └── dummy/        # Fallback implementations for unsupported platforms
├── ui/               # User interface components
├── utils/            # Utility modules
└── __main__.py       # Entry point for the application
```

## Changes Made

1. **OS Adapters Organization**:
   - Moved platform-specific code into `os_adapters` module
   - Created distinct Windows, macOS, and fallback implementations
   - Each platform module exposes consistent interfaces for:
     - Key sending
     - Window focusing
     - Screen capturing

2. **Code Restructuring**:
   - Moved `build.py` to the `scripts` directory
   - Ensured each module has proper imports and exports
   - Made sure the code structure is consistent across platforms

3. **Architecture Improvements**:
   - Created a platform-neutral adapter interface
   - Added fallback implementations for unsupported platforms
   - Created consistent class naming conventions across platforms

4. **Additional Cleanup**:
   - Removed redundant platform-specific files:
     - `key_sender_win.py` and `key_sender_mac.py`
     - `game_focus_win.py` and `game_focus_mac.py`
     - `region_selector_win.py` and `region_selector_mac.py`
   - Removed outdated UI implementations:
     - `auto_fisher_qt.py` and `auto_fisher_ui.py`
   - Removed old core implementations:
     - `auto_fisher.py` and `auto_fisher_realtime.py`
   - Removed utility files integrated into the new structure:
     - `os_utilities.py`
     - `autofishing.py`
   - Removed root-level `build.py` (moved to scripts)

## Benefits

- **Better maintainability**: Code is now organized by function and platform
- **Easier cross-platform support**: Platform-specific code is isolated
- **Simplified imports**: Standard interface for platform-specific functionality
- **Cleaner architecture**: Follows modern Python package structure
- **Reduced code duplication**: Consolidated redundant implementations
- **Reduced clutter**: Removed legacy files that were incorporated into the package

## Next Steps

Potential future improvements:

1. Add more comprehensive testing
2. Improve documentation
3. Consider adding support for Linux
4. Further refine the UI components
